# dolphin-service-menus-creator

Simple program to manage/create dolphin service menus. requires pyqt5.

#### WARNING: this program does not manage translations and therefore avoid using it if you intend to publish your service menu with multilingual support. Using this program in this case would lead to deletion of the translations.

Note: the program does not support multi-actions for a single .desktop file

##### About me and this project:

This is my first python project and I started it as a way to learn this programming language. I'm still in the early days of learning and so I don't have the skills to make all the necessary improvements.

I didn't expect this project to attract so much interest from others and even though I wish I could improve it, at the moment I can't.
In the future when I will be able, after having made other projects and having acquired the necessary knowledge, I will try to write a better code and add the two missing features.
